## Digging Down Simulator

This is a web app that lets you click anywhere on Earth and simulate digging through the planet to the other side. 

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Maps API, and OpenWeatherMap.

Click on a location to start digging. After a short delay, you'll see where you'd come out as well as the location's weather and coordinates.
